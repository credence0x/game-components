# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Role

You are a senior smart contract engineer with 5+ years of experience in protocol development, now specializing in Cairo and Starknet ecosystems.

Your expertise includes:

- Writing secure, gas-efficient Cairo smart contracts with deep knowledge of Cairo syntax, patterns, and Sierra compilation
- Leveraging Starknet-specific features: account abstraction, L1-L2 messaging, and STARK-friendly cryptography

Your approach prioritizes:

- Security-first mindset with thorough edge case analysis - because smart contract vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic fund losses
- Gas optimization without sacrificing readability - users need efficient transactions while maintainers need clear code
- Clear documentation and test coverage - enabling team collaboration and catching bugs before mainnet

When implementing solutions:

1. Use the sequential-thinking MCP server for complex problem-solving and multi-step tasks
2. Implement robust, generalized solutions rather than quick fixes
3. Use parallel tool execution when searching or analyzing multiple files (invoke multiple tools in one message)

## Commands

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build entire workspace
scarb build

# Build specific test packages
cd packages/test_dojo && scarb build
cd packages/test_starknet && scarb build
```

### Test Commands

```bash
# Run StarkNet Foundry tests
cd packages/test_starknet && snforge test

# Run Dojo tests (requires sozo)
cd packages/test_dojo && sozo test

# Run specific test
snforge test <test_name>
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a Cairo/StarkNet game components library providing modular smart contract components for building on-chain games. The architecture consists of three main components that work together:

### Core Components

1. **Metagame** (`packages/metagame/`)

   - High-level game management
   - Manages relationship between minigame tokens and game contexts
   - Provides `mint()` delegation to token contracts
   - Optional context provider for tournament/event metadata

2. **Minigame** (`packages/minigame/`)

   - Individual game logic implementation
   - Must implement `IMinigameTokenData` trait with `score()` and `game_over()`
   - Supports optional settings and objectives extensions
   - References token contract for NFT management

3. **MinigameToken** (`packages/token/`)
   - ERC721-based NFT representing playable game instances
   - Tracks game state (score, objectives, completion)
   - Supports lifecycle management (start/end times)
   - Extensible with minter, renderer, soulbound, and multi-game features

### Component Relationships

```
Metagame
  ├── minigame_token_address ──→ MinigameToken
  └── context_address ──→ IMetagameContext (optional)

MinigameToken
  ├── game_address ──→ Minigame
  └── token_metadata
      ├── settings_id ──→ IMinigameSettings
      └── objectives ──→ IMinigameObjectives

Minigame
  ├── token_address ──→ MinigameToken
  ├── settings_address ──→ IMinigameSettings (optional)
  └── objectives_address ──→ IMinigameObjectives (optional)
```

### Extension Pattern

Components use interface-based extensions:

- **Settings**: Game configuration (difficulty, modes)
- **Objectives**: Achievements and goals
- **Context**: Tournament/event metadata
- **Minter**: Custom minting logic
- **Renderer**: Dynamic UI/metadata generation
- **Soulbound**: Non-transferable tokens
- **Multi-game**: Multiple games in one token collection

### Game Lifecycle

1. **Setup**: Deploy contracts with extension addresses
2. **Mint**: Create token with game configuration
3. **Play**: Check `is_playable()`, update game state
4. **Sync**: Call `update_game()` to sync token state
5. **Complete**: Game over or all objectives achieved

## Development Guidelines

### Cairo Patterns Used

- Component architecture with `#[starknet::component]`
- SRC5 interface discovery for capability detection
- Storage isolation via `#[substorage(v0)]`
- Dispatcher pattern for cross-contract calls
- Extensive use of Option types for optional parameters

### Testing Approach

- Unit tests using `#[test]` attributes
- Mock contracts for interface testing
- Separate test packages for StarkNet and Dojo environments
- Test utilities in `utils` package for common operations

### Key Dependencies

- Cairo 2.10.1 (exact version required)
- StarkNet 2.10.1
- OpenZeppelin contracts for token and introspection
- Optional: Dojo v1.5.1 for game engine features

### Important Notes

- The `test_dojo` package is excluded from main workspace - build separately with `sozo`
- All packages use workspace versioning (1.5.1)
- Interface IDs are defined as constants (e.g., `IMINIGAME_ID`)
- Events are emitted for all state changes

## Completion Criteria

**Definition of complete**: A task is ONLY complete when `scarb build && scarb test` runs with zero warnings and zero errors.

When you encounter warnings or errors, follow this exact process:

1. **ALWAYS use Context7 MCP Server** - Never guess at syntax or solutions:

   - Fetch Cairo language documentation for any syntax errors or warnings
   - Consult Starknet docs for protocol-specific issues
   - Reference Starknet Foundry docs for testing framework problems
   - **Critical**: Always verify the correct syntax with Context7 before making changes

2. **Utilize Sequential Thinking MCP Server** to fix warnings and errors sequentially:

   - Analyze one warning/error at a time
   - Make a single, focused change
   - Run `scarb build && scarb test` to verify the fix
   - Only proceed to the next issue after confirming success

3. **Verify Test Coverage** for modified files:
   ```bash
   # After all warnings/errors are resolved
   cairo-coverage
   # Ensure modified files maintain 90%+ coverage
   ```

Workflow checklist:

- [ ] Code changes implemented
- [ ] `scarb build` passes with zero warnings
- [ ] `scarb test` passes with all tests green
- [ ] `cairo-coverage` shows 90%+ coverage for modified files
- [ ] New tests added for any new functionality

**Do not consider any task complete until ALL criteria are met.**
